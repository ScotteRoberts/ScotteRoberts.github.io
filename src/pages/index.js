            My background supports my ability to contribute. Currently, I am completing a Software
            Engineering training course, offered by <strong>Talent Path</strong> (division of
            Genuent). Each trainee must apply proven leadership qualities, demonstrate their ability
            to collaborate, and finish required tasks with excellence. In addition to my technical
            training, I worked seven full-time summers for the{' '}
            <strong>California Junior Lifeguard Programs (CAJG)</strong>, dedication to the program,
            as a Lifeguard Instructor and for two of those summers as the Managing Director. Skills
            I will apply in your company are:

            I am an avid gamer, beach goer, and internet consumer. Gaming is a core focus and has
            been for as long as I remember. The games are not just video-based. I love all games and
            treat life as the ultimate game.

            Like many of my friends, family, and colleages, the internet has molded my knowledge of
            the world (it is difficult to imagine a world now without it). My goal is to contribute
            my knowledge to make a happy, healthy internet environment for all to learn from and
            embrace.

            My personal hobby is tapping (drums, bongos, cajons, cowbells) and if I can get my hands
            on it, it's going to make some noise.

              A good night's rest, proper hydration, a balanced diet, and stretching will lead to a

            Health is an important factor of everyoneâ€™s life and should be highlighted. According to
            WellSteps, a blog dedicated providing education on employee wellness solutions, a

          <ul>
            <li>improved behavior</li>

            <li>less cost in medical coverage</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I take personal pride in living a healthy, active lifestyle and practice healthy habbits
            during work and personal hours.
