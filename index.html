      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>
        My background supports my ability to contribute. Currently, I am
        completing a Software Engineering training course, offered by Talent
        Path (division of Genuent). Each trainee must apply proven leadership
        qualities, demonstrate their ability to collaborate, and finish required
        tasks with excellence. In addition to my technical training, I worked
        seven full-time summers for the California Junior Lifeguard Programs
        (CAJG), dedication to the program, as a Lifeguard Instructor and for two
        of those summers as the Managing Director. Valuable professional skills
        I learned that will apply to my role at your company include: assessing
        customer needs, resolving immediate issues, planning and implementing
        program tasks. In both my academic and professional life, I have been
        continuously praised as responsible and reliable by my professors and
        peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional
        projects, I apply proven leadership, problem solving, and planning
        skills, which I plan to leverage into the Software Engineering role at
        your company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the applications used by modern companies are web-based or are
        migrating toward web-based solutions. Some of the projects I have lead
        and contributed to are listed in the
        <a href="#projects">projects</a> section. During development, we learned
        organizational project structures and code comments create long-lasting,
        testable and maintainable software. A clean project structure describes
        where everything should exist in a project. Code production and
        maintainability increases when developers know and understand where code
        exists. Code commenting, a vastly underused skill, allows for you and
        other developers to summarize code bodies without needing to understand
        the implementation details. Well documented code is readable to any
        developer and some non-technical professionals. My knowledge of project
        design cycles, and their setbacks enable me to immediately contribute to
        a team across projects. Furthermore, I have been in leadership and
        support positions on software teams. This enables me to understand both
        perspectives of project management and how to closely follow directions
        from a supervisor.
